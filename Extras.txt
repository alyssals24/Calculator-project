To Do:
1. Calculator UI
2. Implement functions for calculator

What works so far:
Single digit calculation
Adding, Subtracting, Multipling, and Division all work
Delete button works
Very simple equations involving two single digit numbers (e.g. 7 + 8)

What doesn't work:
Calulating any numbers with two digits or more
Clear button doesn't work
Calucating more complicated equations (e.g. 78 + 2 x 4)
